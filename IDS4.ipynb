    "In-house labeling often requires dedicated resources, infrastructure, and expertise but offers direct oversight, enabling tailored labeling criteria based on specific project needs. \n",

    "The annotation format in image segmentation involves pixel-level annotations depicting each pixel's membership in a specific object or segment, often represented in masks or pixel-level labels. \n",
